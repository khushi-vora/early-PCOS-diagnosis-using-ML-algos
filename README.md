# Prediction of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) using Optimized Machine Learning Classifiers
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a major cause of infertility in women across the world. Its symptoms include hormone imbalance, irregular menstrual cycle, excess acne, weight gain, and many more. If overlooked, the disease can lead to serious health problems like obstructive sleep apnea, type-2 diabetes, obesity, heart disease, mood disorders, etc. Thus, early detection of PCOS is important. This project proposes a system for early prediction of PCOS using optimized machine learning classifiers. Extensive EDA was done on the dataset and out of 45 available features, 6 were selected using the Pearson statistical correlation coefficient. In addition to the EDA performed, oversampling was also done in order to handle the class imbalance problem by increasing the number of minority class samples.  Optimized machine learning classifiers are classifiers with the best set of available hyperparameters that helps us achieve the highest prediction accuracy.  Among the set of 11 optimized classifiers, Optimized KNN gave the best prediction accuracy of 0.995.

We split the machine learning algorithms we wanted to run between ourselves and coded for each of them. This was during the first prototype period of the project. After that, we worked on using Matlab to optimise our model. We ran more machine learning algorithms on Matlab and did hyperparameter tuning for some them. This helped us determine the best model for our data.
